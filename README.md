# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict heart disease based on patient health data. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics. The project includes:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Feature engineering to improve model performance.
- Building and evaluating several machine learning models.

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

  ## Results
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The best-performing model is selected based on these metrics.
